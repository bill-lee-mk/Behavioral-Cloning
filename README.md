# Behavioral Cloning

### Simulator.
Download the Unity simulator for term 1 version 2 from [link](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim)

Overview
---

The simulator can steer a car around a track for data collection, use image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.


The goals / steps are the following:

* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.


## Details About Files

### `drive.py`

`drive.py` save the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

This will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.


#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

```

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.
